//Industry tile sprites; one sprite for each tile; eventually more for each tile to include  construction stages

//Tile action 1
//not used for forest currently - uses base set sprites 

//Defines are used to set ground tile and tree/other sprites
//To cater for complex stuff (e.g. snow / not snow / partial stuff), repeat each tile set new defines
//Repeat as many times as needed.  Use terrain check to decide which tile set is actually needed

//Set IDs for tree tile sprites
