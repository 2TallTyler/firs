0.2 Release
-----------

*Important*
The grfID has changed in FIRS 0.2.  It is *not* savegame compatible with any previous release of FIRS.


*What's new in 0.2?*

Over 230 changes since FIRS 0.1.2

Introduced new industries:
- Lumber Yard: produces Engineering Supplies from Lumber and Chemicals
- Gas Station: accepts Food, Goods, Fuel Oil.  Locates in town only.  Graphics are temporary and will be replaced.

Clustering for primary industries (farms, mines, forests, plantations).  These industries will locate in clusters when constructed by the game during map generation or randomly during gameplay.  Players may build these industries anywhere during gameplay or in scenario editor.  The number of clusters is adjusted to suit the map size.  Thanks Planetmaker, Yexo and Frosch for making this feature possible.*

Anti-clustering for most secondary industries.  This prevents secondary industries of the same type locating next to each other when constructed by the game during map generation or randomly during gameplay.  Players may build these industries anywhere during gameplay or in scenario editor.*

*Clustering only available in OpenTTD nightly r19902 or newer.  Will fail gracefully in older versions.

Tweaked numerous production levels.  
- Farms now have much lower production.  Use feeder services or one large station to cover multiple farms.
- Oil wells have much higher production.  Oil was not widely available enough on the map.  More industries now use chemicals, so the oil cargo chain is a little more important in gameplay.

Aluminium Plant production changes:
- now accepts Chemicals.  Chemicals are a small but important cargo for real-life Aluminium production, and this makes for nice gameplay.
- production is now 'combinatory'.  Delivering more than one cargo type within a month will increase output ratios (a good change requested by Terkhen to balance Aluminium Plant better against the Steel Mill).

Seriously improved map colours.  Seriously.

Space out General Stores within a town.  This uses 'prevent conflicting industry types' rather than the FIRS anti-clustering code.  Please report if the effects are weird.

Rework of strings / translation framework to correctly support UTF-8.  Entirely the work of Planetmaker and Terkhen - thanks.

Spanish translation updated (Terkhen)

Reporting of errors in-game is more useful.  Entirely the work of Planetmaker - thanks.

Fruit and Vegetables cargo had the wrong cargo classes defined.  Now fixed.

Changes to industry colours:
- more industries now use industry colours
- some industry colours are now prevented from appearing because they just suck 

Completely revised graphics and layouts for:
- Fertiliser Plant
- Aluminium Plant

Snow sprites for several more industries (thanks Irwe!)

Many new / additional layouts for industries including:
- Arable Farm
- Bakery
- Brewery
- Cement Plant
- Dairy
- Furniture Factory
- Glass Works
- Junk Yard
- Machine Shop
- Plastic Plant
- Textile Mill

Improved detail and anti-aliasing of graphics for many industries including:
- Cement Plant
- Furniture Factory
- Machine Shop
- Textile Mill
...and more.
