1 Compiling
-----------

In order to compile FIRS from source you need the STABLE VERSIONS of NFORenum (v3.4.6) and GRFCodec (v0.9.10). At the moment, building FIRS with the latest builds WILL FAIL.
Place both renum and grfcodec in the FIRS main directory and run either 'make', 'make install', 'make bundle' or 'make release'. There's more options, but these are probably sufficient.

GRF Name: {{GRF_TITLE}}
