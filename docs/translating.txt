In order to translate firs copy /sprites/nfo/lang/01_english.pnfo and rename it appropriately in the same <id>_<language>.pnfo format. You can find the ID in the list here: http://wiki.ttdpatch.net/tiki-index.php?page=Action4#language_id

Next, open the file using your favourite plain text editor and first change the few bits at the top:
//Language: <language>
//Lang-ID: <id> -> <id+80h>

Next, do a search and replace for "04 0B 81", replacing it with "04 0B <id+80h>" (without the quotes).

<id+80h> is the actual ID from the list (http://wiki.ttdpatch.net/tiki-index.php?page=Action4#language_id) with 80 (in hex) added to it.
So if you're translating to Swedish for instance, <id> equals 2E and thus <id+80h> equals AE, so in that case use "04 0B AE" for the replace.

Now go ahead and translate the strings. Only translate things enclosed in quotes ("). Under no circumstance change anything else (except the search-and-replace above) or you'll most likely break things. Also leave spaces in front of strings intact.

The various two-letter strings are abbreviations for the cargo shown in some places in the game GUI. Feel free to translate those as well, but make sure that you don't create duplicates with the original game cargos.

When done, submit the file in the topic http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=41607. We only accept new translations after the release of version 0.1.0, so you might want to wait a bit before starting a translation.

Developers: also add a new translation to Makefile.config
