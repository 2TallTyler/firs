New Industries and Cargos for OpenTTD

Features improved gameplay and good support from vehicle sets.

-------------------
Vehicle Set Support
-------------------
Furthermore you need a vehicle set that supports the FIRS cargos. Any vehicle
set with proper Cargo Classes support should do that by default. The OpenTTD
vehicles will not be able to transport all FIRS cargos. The following sets
available from the OpenTTD built-in download manager are known to support FIRS:
- Train Sets:
  - 2cc Train Set
  - North American Renewal Set (NARS) 2
  - Old Wagons with New Cargos 1.1
  - UK Renewal Train Set v3
  - DB Set XL (with FIRS extension - partial support)
  - UK Railway Set (UKRS2)
  - OpenGFX+ Trains
- Road Vehicle Sets:
  - eGRVTS v1.0
  - HEQS (Heavy Equipment Set)
  - OpenGFX+ Road Vehicles
- Ship sets
  - FISH
  - New Ships (partial support)
- Plane Sets
 - AV8
 - GeneralAv8ion
 - Plane Set

(Contact a FIRS developer to have your own set listed here)

4 Errors and warnings
---------------------
FIRS is not compatible with all other NewGRFs out there. Great care has been
taken to locate all incompatible NewGRFs, but not all may have been found.
In case FIRS is able to detect an incompatible NewGRF, it will issue an error
(and disable itself) or issue a warning. Below you will find an explanation of
possible errors and warnings.

A full list of conflicting newgrfs can be found here:
  http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/firs/repository/entry/sprites/nml/checks.pnml

E00: FIRS requires...
FIRS requires a reasonably recent version of OpenTTD, as listed in the error
message, and cannot work on older versions due to missing features.
Either upgrade your OpenTTD to at least on of the versions indicated in the
error message or don't use FIRS.

E01: Incompatible set...
FIRS has detected an other NewGRF that conflicts with FIRS' features and
possibilities. If you want to use FIRS, you have to remove the indicated NewGRF
from the active NewGRF files list. After doing so, you might receive the same
warning but then for a different NewGRF. Continue to remove all NewGRFs
indicated until the error messages disappear.

E02: Incompatible parameter...
Some NewGRFs have parameter options that are incompatible with FIRS. To use FIRS,
you have to change the parameter settings of the NewGRF idicated in the error
message. What parameter to change to what value is indicated as well.

E03: Incompatible version...
Only more recent versions of the NewGRF indicated are compatible with FIRS. If
you want to use the indicated NewGRF together with FIRS, you should upgrade that
NewGRF to at least the version indicated.

E04: Incompatible version...
Only more recent versions of the NewGRF indicated are compatible with FIRS. If
you want to use the indicated NewGRF together with FIRS, you should upgrade that
NewGRF to at least the version indicated.

W01: Possible set incompatibility detected...
If you receive this warning, FIRS is not sure if the NewGRF indicated is
compatible or not. You need to check the version of the NewGRF indicated
manually. If you continue to use an incompatible NewGRF together with FIRS, you
may not complain about possible problems in FIRS ;)
