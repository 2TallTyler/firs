    <p>Installing FIRS is easy using the in-game content service.
    For help with manual installation, try http://wiki.openttd.org/NewGRF</p>


    <h3>Setting up a game with FIRS</h3>

    <p>To avoid conflicts, FIRS will disable itself if certain other newgrfs are
    detected in the current game.  You'll see a message if this happens.</p>

    <p>Conflicting newgrfs include other industry sets, such as ECS and PBI.
    You can find a full list of errors towards the end of this readme.</p>


    <p>FIRS has a number of parameters to control industry behaviour.
    These cover things like industry production changes, closure and opening.
    The parameters generally include help text explaining how they work.</p>

    <p>Many FIRS cargos are not transportable using the default vehicles.
    You'll need newgrf vehicle set(s) that support FIRS cargos.  Fortunately there
    are lots of great vehicle sets with FIRS support.  The in-game content service
    is a good place to find these.
    You can find a list of compatible vehicle sets towards the end of this readme.</p>
