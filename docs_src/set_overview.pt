    <p>FIRS requires OpenTTD 1.2.0-beta1 or newer (or nightly build > r23667)</p>

    <p>FIRS is available in the Temperate, Arctic and Desert climates.</p>

    <p>Installing FIRS is easy using the in-game content service.
    For help with manual installation, try http://wiki.openttd.org/NewGRF</p>


    <h3>Setting up a game with FIRS</h3>

    <p>To avoid conflicts, FIRS will disable itself if certain other newgrfs are
    detected in the current game.  You'll see a message if this happens.</p>

    <p>Conflicting newgrfs include other industry sets, such as ECS and PBI.
    You can find a full list of errors towards the end of this readme.</p>


    <p>FIRS has a number of parameters to control industry behaviour.
    These cover things like industry production changes, closure and opening.
    The parameters generally include help text explaining how they work.</p>

    <p>Many FIRS cargos are not transportable using the default vehicles.
    You'll need newgrf vehicle set(s) that support FIRS cargos.  Fortunately there
    are lots of great vehicle sets with FIRS support.  The in-game content service
    is a good place to find these.
    You can find a list of compatible vehicle sets towards the end of this readme.</p>


    <h3>Playing a game with FIRS</h3>
    You can jump right into FIRS gameplay:
    - there are familiar industries and cargos you'll recognise from default OpenTTD
    - FIRS also adds lots of exciting new cargos and industries to play with
    - primary industries like mines and farms will always produce some cargo
    - secondary industries like the steel mill and cement plant will always produce
      some output cargo when an input cargo is delivered.

    <p>For players who want more, FIRS also rewards you by:
    - increasing primary industry production when you deliver supplies regularly
    - increasing production at some secondary industries when you deliver more than
      one input cargo regularly
    - introducing new industries and cargos as time goes by.</p>

    <h3>More Info / Things to Watch Out For!</h3>
    <p>- primary industry will not increase production unless supplies are delivered.
    - primary industry will always produce cargo. There is no need to deliver supplies
    to get cargo produced, only for production increases.
    - when small amounts of cargo (less than 8t) are delivered to secondary industries,
    this will be stored until there is enough to produce a certain amount of output
    cargo. It can appear that such small amounts of cargo are lost, but they aren't.
    - some industries are available from year 0. Some industries (and the cargos
      they use) are only available after a certain date.
      Intro dates can be found at:
        http://tt-foundry.com/sets/FIRS/schema/industries
    - You may find it easier to see industries on the mini-map if you change the
      map background colour (in advanced options -> interface)
    - FIRS 0.7 is *not* savegame compatible with FIRS 0.6 or earlier.</p>


    <h3>Boosting Primary Production</h3>
    <p>Primary industries produce raw materials, e.g.
    - mines, farms, junk yard, oil wells, oil rig etc.</p>

    <p>Many FIRS primary industries accept Engineering Supplies or Farm Supplies.
    They will only increase production if the correct supplies are delivered.</p>

    <p>Every month there is a chance of a production increase if at least 1t of the
    correct supplies are delivered.
    Only 1t of supplies is required - delivering more than 1t of supplies will
    not make a production increase more likely.</p>


    <h3>Industry Closure</h3>
    <p>Industries won't close unless closure is enabled by parameter.</p>

    <p>If primary industry closure is enabled, there is a chance of closure each
    month if industry production falls to a low level.  Primary production decrease
    parameter *must* be enabled if you want primary industries to be able to close.</p>

    <p>If secondary industry closure is enabled, there is a chance of closure each
    month if no cargo has been delivered in the previous 18 months.</p>
